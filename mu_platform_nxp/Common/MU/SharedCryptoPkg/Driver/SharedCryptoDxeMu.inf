#  This module consolidates all crypto needed for Project Mu UEFI and provides
#  protocol for those functions. This protocol provides a subset of BaseCryptLib.
#
#  see Readme.md in SharedCryptoPkg
#  There are a few flavors of support from the protocol and this is just one version.
#  This supports just the functions that Project Mu uses.
