/**
  This function allows a caller to extract the current configuration for one
  or more named elements from the target driver.


  @param This            Points to the EFI_HII_CONFIG_ACCESS_PROTOCOL.
  @param Request         A null-terminated Unicode string in <ConfigRequest> format.
  @param Progress        On return, points to a character in the Request string.
                         Points to the string's null terminator if request was successful.
                         Points to the most recent '&' before the first failing name/value
                         pair (or the beginning of the string if the failure is in the
                         first name/value pair) if the request was not successful.
  @param Results         A null-terminated Unicode string in <ConfigAltResp> format which
                         has all values filled in for the names in the Request string.
                         String to be allocated by the called function.

  @retval  EFI_SUCCESS            The Results is filled with the requested values.
  @retval  EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   Not enough memory to store the results.
  @retval  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Request is illegal syntax, or unknown name.
  @retval  EFI_NOT_FOUND          Routing data doesn't match any storage in this driver.
